Exams
=====

We will close this course with an exam in form of a final project.
This final project shall be on a topic of your choice or on one of the topics we provide as example topics.
**The final project shall be handed in as a Jupyter Notebook and a short Video presenting the notebook. Each individual student is required to hand in a Jupyter Notebook. No group work is allowed.

All notebooks shall follow the following outline

- **Introduction** You introduce into the problem your are covering with your notebook and motivate what your are going to do. The Introduction should also cover a basic theoretical description for the problem to be solved.
- **Results & Discussion** You develop the code for your problem and discuss and anotate the individual steps in your notebook. It is important the you discuss the individual results highlighting their consequences.
- **Summary** You summarize your findings.


The videos shall 

- explain what topic you have chosen and why
- explain how you tackled the problem
- show quickly the main results
- summarize what you think you have achieved


The videos will be made available to all students in the course after they have been handed in. They will be able to rate the videos. The notbooks will be graded. 

The deadline for handing in the project is **3. September 2022** 

The projects and videos shall be handed in via the `Molecular Nanophotonics Website <https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~physik/sites/mona/teaching/periodic-lectures/introduction-to-computer-based-physical-modeling-ss-2021/>`_


Since many of you asked for some guiding topics abnd I as well hope that you do not submit a simulation of planetary motion, here are some topics, though some of them might be for the advanced physicist.


Mechanics
=========
- planetary motion (of course)
- the Brachistochrone, first find out what it is, and then simulate it
- N-coupled pendula and mechanical waves
- elastic/inelastic collisions 
- spinning top


Thermodynamics/Statistical Physics
==================================
- ideal gas law from microscopic particle motions and wall collisions
- Maxwell deamon, find out what it is and simulate
- entropy from microstates
- Carnot cycle 
- Vicsek model, find out what it is and simulate


Optics
======
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces with paraxial approximation
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces without paraxial approximation
- imaging errors, aberations 
- ray tracing of a prism with wavelength dependent refractive index
- light propagation though and optical fiber


Electrodynamics
===============
- thin film interference
- electromagnetic wave propagation through thin films (Fresnel coefficients)
- double slit experiment with light 
- grating diffraction, grating resolution
- scattering of an electron on a Coulomb potential (classical)
- array of freely rotating magnets

Quantum Mechanics
=================
- wave packet in a periodic potential
- scattering of an electron on a coulomb potential (quantum mechanical)
